# SNHU-CS340-Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
One feature of maintainable, readable and adaptable code is leaving good comments in the code. It is important to only leave comments that are necessary. Excessive commenting could achieve the opposite effect. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) module implements the four major operations which are implemented in databases. The common SQL equivalents are Insert, Select, Update and Delete. 


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist my main objective is to write code that is efficient while accomplishing the clients specifications for the desired product. My approach to this project included various tools that I have never used before in another class. One of those tools was using MongoDB which is a NoSQL database. My main techniques for learning to use these new tools was to read class resources, documentation and watching tutorials. All of these techniques are usable on other projects.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists solve problems that help their client achieve a desired result. Solving the problem includes choosing the most efficient data structures and algorithms to provide the most efficient code possible. Addtionally, ensuring the code is secure is essential. Implementing industry best standards is important. My work on this project has provided me with some practice to help me become more proficient with this process.
